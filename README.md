# LabyrinthGameUsingOpenGL
A simple labyrinth game where the objective is to get to the finish line without colliding with the maze.<br />
However, this is mainly a pedantic venture and was a class project<br />
Some instructions in [Instructions.doc](http://github.com/yousuf031991/LabyrinthGameUsingOpenGL/blob/master/Instructions.docx)<br />
The right click menu showcases some pedantic as well as functional aspects of the game including:
* Switching views between an overview and a FPS view
* Changing speed of the car/player/game
* Switching between moving the light sources and moving the car/player
* Changing materials (using the Phong model)
* Changing the plane surface shape using noise.
* Normal visualisation
